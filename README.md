Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eda Tetik, currently pursuing a Master's degree in IT in the United States. 
Throughout my academic journey, I've been diving into Front-end development, constantly honing my skills. 
My goal is always to produce code that is not only functional but also practical and readable. 
As a Frontend Developer, I am committed to continuous self-improvement, leveraging a skill set encompassing HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Bootstrap. 
My proficiency extends beyond mere coding; it involves crafting dynamic and aesthetically pleasing web pages, where each line of code serves as a brushstroke in the canvas of user experience.
